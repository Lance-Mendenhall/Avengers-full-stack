Avengers battle

This program creates a full python stack using TKinter, Python,, and a SQLite database. The data program must be run first to populate the database. 

Running the av04.py will allow Avengers to battle. Each avenger is assigned a power level from 1 to 10, and a D10 is rolled on top of that.
